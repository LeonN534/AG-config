# LeonN's config files for Half - Life / Adrenaline Gamer

A brief description of my AG config is that I like it to look simple: I don´t like gibs flying around or big explosions because these all will interfere with your gameplay, making it difficult to spot the enemy or knowing what is happening in your sorroundings.

In order to achieve that, I replaced the gib models with transparent ones, I created some gray textures to let you spot the enemy as soon as it appears on the screen, disabled the w_models to gain more visibility and aim fluently, replaced most useless sprites
with transparent ones, replaced the sky boxes textures with completely blackones so it won´t interfere with my sight while flying on the air. I use the fast fps weapon v_models because they do not disturb your reaction, 
so, when you see a red or blue spot on your screen, you immediately know it´s a player.

Besides, I replaced a lot of weapong sounds because i like them to sounds "modern" or whatever, I just liked the new sounds so I used them :).
